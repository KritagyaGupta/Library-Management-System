LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Library Management System allows the user to store the book details and the person's details. This software allows storing the details of all the data related to library. The implementation of the system will reduce data entry time and provide readily calculated reports

Introduction
Library is a very important part of student’s life it is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources. A Library Management System is a project that has been developed to handle basic housekeeping functions of a library.

It’s a well organized solution for a library. It helps to provide information on any book present in library to the user.

It keeps a record of book issued and books added to library.

Project Description
Library Management System which is used to manage the record of books and students. The project is a menu driven program as when we run the main class we get seven options that will be displayed as:

Add new Book.
Increase Quantity of a Book.
Show All Books.
Register Student.
Show All Registered Students.
Issue Book.
Exit
When we select the 1st option i.e. Add new book we can add a new book in the record of library with details such as book name, author name, SNo and Quantity.

When we select 2nd option i.e. Increase quantity of books we can increase the quantity of any book which is present in the record.

When we select 3rd option i.e. Show all books we will see all the books present in the library with all their details.

When we select 4th option i.e. Register Student we can register a student in the record by entering the details of students such as First Name, Last Name, Sap ID, Course, Batch etc.

When we select 5th option i.e. Show all registered students we will see all the students registered in the record with their details.

When we select 6th option i.e. Issue Book only the registered student can issue a book from the library and if the student is not registered then he’ll have to first register himself then only he’ll be able to register book.

When we select 7th option i.e. Exit we will be exited out of the program.

Objective
It helps in maintaining a track of records of all students and their complete details

It manages the record of book and all the details of book

It provides timely access to request materials

Problem Statement
Based on the observation, there isn’t a proper library management system for the students. So, students need to go to the library to check whether a certain book is available or not. They can register themselves to the library from this only they need not go to library for this sole purpose.
